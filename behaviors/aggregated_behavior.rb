    # Adds aggregated behavior to a model. An aggregated model tries to insure
    # it will not duplicate itself for whatever parents it belongs to. Whenever
    # an aggregated model is about to be saved, it uses its attributes to
    # perform a lookup for an existing record with the same attributes. If the
    # lookup succeeds, its id is used to replace id of model being saved, and
    # no 'INSERT' statement is executed. If the lookup fails, the original AR
    # save routines are performed.
